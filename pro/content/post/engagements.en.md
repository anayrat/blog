## Independence

As an independent freelancer not attached to any company, I don't have any "in-house solutions" to sell you.
I have only two affections: Postgres and Opensource.

## No bullshit

No buzzword. I'll recommend proven solutions. If not, I'll warn you about the possible risks (reliability, lack of maturity...).

If I don't have the skills, no shame, I'll simply tell you.

## Freedom first

I know how to recognize business needs, and I may have to present proprietary solutions.

However, I'll also introduce open-source solutions whenever possible.

## Technical watch

I keep a technical watch on Postgres and its ecosystem. I try to follow the Postgres [mailing-list](https://www.postgresql.org/list/).

## Fairness

I don't falsify the results of a report. It's important to be transparent.
