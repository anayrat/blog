For 7 years, I held various positions as a system and network engineer. And it was in 2014 when I started to put my fingers in PostgreSQL.
Step by step, I climbed the steps, and over the years I've held positions as a consultant, trainer, but also production DBA (Doctolib, Peopledoc).
{style="text-align: justify;"}

Attached to open source, I have both participated in community events:

* French-speaking conferences at [PG Day France](https://pgday.fr/): I was a participant as well as a [speaker](https://blog.anayrat.info/project/pgdayfr/).
* International conferences:
  * The [PGCon](https://www.pgcon.org) in Ottawa, Canada. This is **the** world conference for Postgres developers.
  * [PostgreSQL Europe](https://www.pgconf.eu). Europe's biggest conference, 600 participants, 3 tracks over 3 days.
  * The [pgDay Paris](https://www.pgday.paris). The annual English-speaking conference in Paris. I was lucky enough to be part of the 2020 selection committee, unfortunately cancelled due to COVID. But that's only a matter of time, as I'm back on the selection committee for 2024.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

I've also had the opportunity to make a few [contributions to the engine](https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git&a=search&h=HEAD&st=commit&s=nayrat&.cgifields=sr). I also participate in various projects in its ecosystem ([PoWA](https://powa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), Openstreetmap ...)
{style="text-align: justify;"}

Since the beginning of 2021 I have been providing freelance consultancy services. I only offer service on PostgreSQL (on-premise, AWS RDS, Google, GCP, Heroku, Clever cloud...). Here's an overview of what I can do:
{style="text-align: justify;"}

* Audit/advice and architecture consulting: connection pooler, pgbouncer
* Engine and operating system tuning (linux)
* Remote DBA
* Query optimization
* Database Design
* Backups
* Engine-specific supervision (Nagios, icinga, Datadog)
* Physical and logical replication
* Skills transfer
* Advanced uses of Postgres: partitioning, Full Text Search, indexing strategies...
* Cost reduction with cloud providers


My main strengths are expertise and innovation. The idea is to create a virtuous circle: the customer has a problem => I solve it => the customer becomes more skilled and autonomous, then contacts me again for a more complex problem where I can also learn and grow.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

I work with all kinds of customers:

* Government: Hopitaux de Paris (APHP), ACOSS, DGFIP...
* Start-ups: Alma, Welcome to the Jungle, Elevo, Plum Energie, Major Corp...
* Major groups : CNP...
* SMEs: Frisquet, Plum Energie...

Thus, I've come across a multitude of environments (large-scale production, on-premise, cloud) with security and service availability challenges (health, finance...).
{style="text-align: justify;"}

I also have a [technical blog](https://blog.anayrat.info) which I encourage you to visit.
