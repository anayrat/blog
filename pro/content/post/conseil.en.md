Some customers just need a little advice on which direction to go in.
A short consultancy session can save you from making mistakes that could be fatal in the future.


* How do I build my architecture?
* What are the advantages/disadvantages of using a particular type of data (`UUID`, `JSON`...)?
* Do I need to shard my database?
* How can I perform full-text searches?
* How do I partition?
* What type of instance should I choose?
* Which server should I buy?
* Which monitoring solution?

Here's a non-exhaustive list of the subjects I work on:

* Audit/consulting and architecture consulting: connection pooler, pgbouncer
* Cost reduction with cloud providers
* Engine and operating system tuning (Linux)
* Query optimization
* Modeling consulting
* Backup (and restore!)
* Postgres monitoring (Nagios, icinga, Datadog)
* Physical and logical replication
* Advanced uses of postgres: partitioning, Full Text Search, indexing strategies, sharding...


In all cases, I will respect my [commitments]({{< ref "engagements" >}}), I will not recommend a solution that I would not want in production.
