I fell into PostgreSQL in 2014 and since then, this open source DBMS has never left me :smile:
{style="text-align: justify;"}

At Dalibo, I acquired a good knowledge of Postgres and SQL that I used in my work as a consultant. These included training, postgres tuning, participation in the PostgreSQL community (conferences, open source projects, writing articles, [patches](https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git&a=search&h=HEAD&st=commit&s=nayrat&.cgifields=sr)...).

At Doctolib, I acquired a strong experience in maintaining in operational conditions a high volume production with high throughput, with significant challenges in terms of service performance, security and availability: ~45,000 transactions per second on a database of more than 3.5TB with very strong growth.

Then at PeopleDoc, I joined a DBA team where my role was to make sure that production runs smoothly, communicate best practices to developers, and optimize platforms for performance. I was also involved in writing blue-green migration in as transparent a way as possible for the application and without downtime.

Since 2021 I am available for freelance missions:
- architecture consulting
- tuning
- query optimization
- database design
- replication
- training

I am also determined to maintain my involvement in the PostgreSQL community. Thus, you can meet me at community events (conferences, meetup...) and also on Postgres' mailing list ;)

Here you will find articles (mostly in French but I try to translate them) about PostgreSQL (but not only :smile:). As well as the presentations that I could make during conferences. Feel free to open an issue on [github](https://github.com/anayrat/blog) ;)
