abstract: Released in January 2016, PostgreSQL 9.5 introduces  BRIN indexes for Block
  Ranges Index. This type of index looks promising for high volumetry where there
  is a strong correlation between the data and their location. First part of the talk
  (in french) will be dedicated to their functioning and specificities. From this
  information it will then be possible to identify use cases.
